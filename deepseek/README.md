# DeepSeek sample

Tests the `deepseek-chat` model by asking it to tell a joke, and pretty prints any JSON error that occurs. This is a very simple example and does not handle any of the advanced features of the underlying RIG client.

The `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable must be set in order to run this example.
